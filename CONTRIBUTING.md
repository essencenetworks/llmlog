# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution! This project aims to keep **LLMLOG/1.0** tiny and stable.

## Principles
- Prefer **backwards‑compatible** changes.
- Keep the spec minimal; propose additions only with real‑world examples.
- Parsers should **ignore unknown keys**; avoid breaking changes to BEGIN/END grammar.

## How to contribute
1. Open an issue describing the problem, with example blocks.
2. Propose exact spec wording (if applicable).
3. Keep PRs focused and small; include updated examples/spec text.

## Areas most welcome
- Parsers in other languages (Go, Node, Rust, Ruby, etc.).
- Real‑world examples and workflows.
- Minimal tooling (validators, converters) that remain optional.
